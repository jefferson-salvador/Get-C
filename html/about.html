                            <p>I'm a third year student in Technological University of the Philippines- Manila. My birthday is January 18, 1998, and that makes me 22 years old. I came from the province of Davao Oriental, Mindanao, Philippines, but now I am living in the City of Bacoor, Province of Cavite. My biological mother is Juditha Salvador and my father is Felipe Salvador.</p>

                            
                            <p>Before I went and study in Technological University of the Philippines- Manila, I used to study in Zapote Elementary School, Bacoor National High School- Tabing Dagat, then Asian Institute of Computer Studies- Bacoor. I also studied in DataCom- Bacoor just for a certificate of Information and Communication Technology during my summer days back on 2016.</p>

                            <p>My hobbies are drawing, making artsy stuff, learning new things, watching movie, browsing in social media, and many more. Sometimes, I use my free time to draw and earn money if some offer me commission.</p>
                            
                            <p>Talking about my achievements, let's start when I was in elementary level. Grade 1 I got 1st honorable mention, grade 3 I was 2nd honor, grade 4 I was 3rd honor, grade 5 I was 3rd honor, then grade 6, I graduated as a third honor. Now in junior high school, I didn't received any award but was always one of the top 10 in our classroom from grade 7 to grade 9 (maybe I am in adjustment phase that time), but, I became a champion in rubics cube competition when I was grade 10 and graduated as 1st honorable mention. Now, senior high school is my glowing but haggard phase. Since grade 11 I am top 1 in our classroom, considered the best in most of the subjects, graduated as best in programming, me and my team was the best in thesis in our batch and also, I was awarded valedictorian with highest honor. Now, In my college life, I haven't received any award yet, but, I am a consistent deans lister (sometimes president's lister), and also won 3rd place in a C language dev competition when I was in 2nd yr.</p>
                            
                            <p>I have no job experience yet except from becoming a freelance portrait artist and graphic artist and working in a postal servicing company Philippine Postal Corporation- Bacoor for my on-the-job training. I worked there as an encoder and assistant. Despite of the fact that I lack in working experience, I am always looking forward for an opportunity to learn and be part of a professional company. I promise that I will do my best to do my duty with passion and creativity. Learning is what gives hope to my heart to dream and be passionate in everything that I do. People is capable of learning new things, but in my case, I will always turn learning into earning and give my company a better view and upper hand in this competitive industry.</p>
